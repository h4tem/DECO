## Overview

This repository contains an **unofficial PyTorch implementation** of **DECO**, a DETR-like object detection framework described in the paper **"UNLEASHING THE POTENTIAL OF CONVNETS FOR QUERY-BASED DETECTION AND SEGMENTATION"** where the standard self-attention and cross-attention are replaced by purely convolutional modules (InterConv). Our goal is to replicate the main ideas from the paper and provide an easy-to-run codebase for further research.

## Features
- Replaces attention with:
  - Self-Interaction Module (SIM)
  - Cross-Interaction Module (CIM)
- Compatible with standard backbones like ResNet18.
- Uses Hungarian matching and the set-based loss from DETR.
- Reasonable training speed and memory usage on a single RTX 2080. (We hope at least haha :D)
